## Professional Summary

Engineer and educator with 12+ years supporting U.S. Army and Department of Defense modernization initiatives, specializing in secure systems engineering, data pipelines, automation, and applied machine learning.

My work increasingly focuses on Knowledge-Based AI, symbolic reasoning, and cognitive architectures through Georgia Tech’s OMSCS program — applying structured AI methods to operational and security challenges.

I am particularly interested in hybrid symbolic + statistical AI approaches for mission-critical systems.
